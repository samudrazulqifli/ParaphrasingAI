They are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server or responding to user input.\n\nFor example, consider a function that fetches data from a server:\n\n```\nfunction fetchData(url, callback) {\n  // Make a request to the server\n  // When the response is received, call the callback function\n  // and pass the response data as an argument\n  // ...\n  callback(responseData);\n}\n```\n\nThe `fetchData` function takes a URL and a callback function as arguments. It makes a request to the server and when the response is received, it calls the callback function and passes the response data as an argument.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `fetchData` function with a callback:\n\n```\nfetchData('https://example.com/data', function(data) {\n  // Do something with the data\n  console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we pass a function as the second argument to `fetchData`. This function will be called when the response is received and will log the data to the console.\n\nCallbacks can also be named functions that are defined separately and passed as arguments:\n\n```\nfunction processData(data) {\n  // Do something with the data\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\nfetchData('https://example.com/data', processData);\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a separate function `processData` that takes the response data as an argument and logs it to the console.
